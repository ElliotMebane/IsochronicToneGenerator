# IsochronicToneGenerator
Plugin for Isochronic Tone Generation in Audacity  
  
These are modified versions of the Isochronic Modulator Audacity plugin originally written by Steve Daulton.   
(https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Nyquist_Effect_Plug-ins#Isochronic_modulator)  
  
*IsomodExtended.ny*  
Initial Modulation Frequency and Final Modulation Frequency increased to 150 to allow gamma frequencies.  
  
*IsomodInOut.ny*  
Allows separate Fade-in and Fade-out settings instead of just one time setting used for both in the original plugin.  
  
*IsomodEnvelope.ny*  
Allows traditional envelope settings (attack, decay, sustain, release)  
  
Blog post from Brian Slartsani's blog The Dynamic State and does a good job of describing how to use the original Isochronic Modulator plugin.
